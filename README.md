## I've recently updated my website with a fun interactive Whack-A-Cat game. This consists of the cats pouncing and jumping out of Cotton Candy for you the user to click on the cheeky cat to whack it back then gain a point for how many cheeky cats your able to catch. In order to start the game You the User must click on the start button for the cats to get ready to pounce.

### I think that If I would have had more time I would of made my website into a comic strip, simply because I'm a huge fan of comics. Also It would of been quite imaginary flicking through the pages of the site and even clicking on the images interactively with classic comic quote bubbles defining what the image means. I even had an idea of using my illustrations to maybe come up with a comic story in the website and making those illustrations interactive hehe
