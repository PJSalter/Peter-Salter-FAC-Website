## I've recently updated my website with a fun interactive Whack-A-Cat game :cat: :paw_prints:. This consists of the cats pouncing and jumping out of Cotton Candy :pouting_cat: :lollipop: for you the user to click on the cheeky cat :cat2: to whack it back then gain a point for how many cheeky cats your able to catch :smiley_cat:. In order to start the game You the User must click on the start button for the cats to get ready to pounce :joy_cat: :candy: :dango: :lollipop: :joy_cat:.

### :pushpin: :notebook: :paperclip: I think that If I would have had more time I would of made my website into a comic strip, simply because I'm a huge fan of comics :green_book:. Also It would of been quite imaginary flicking through the pages of the site :page_facing_up: and even clicking on the images interactively with classic comic quote bubbles :thought_balloon: defining what the image means :speech_balloon:. I even had an idea of using my illustrations to maybe come up with a comic story in the website and making those illustrations interactive hehe
